# Mastermind2.0

## Overview
Mastermind is a deductive reasoning game. The player's goal is to correctly identify the secret number combination code. Every guess the player attempts will be followed by feedback from the computer whether the user guessed a number correctly and/or if it was in the correct position. The player's task is to analyze the feedback and deduce the secret code. Ten guess attempts will be given.  
## Game Rules
* At the start of the game the computer will randomly select a combination code of four different numbers. 
* The possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Duplicates are allowed, for example: 3389 or 7567.
* The player has 10 attempts to determine the secret code.
* Each guess attempt will be given feedback on how many numbers are correct and/or how many numbers correct and in the correct position or none correct. 
* In this version of Mastermind, Red pegs signify right number and right position, while white pegs signify right number, wrong position. 
* For example, if the secret code is 4556 and the players guesses 5357 the feedback for that guess would be one red peg and one white peg. It would not indicate which numbers corresponded to those pegs. 
* One must use logical deduction to determine the secret code. 
* A player who guesses the secret number combination code by their 10th attempt will win!
